                <p>I no longer equate <em>thinking</em> I'm right about something with actually <em>being</em> right about it.  </p>
<p>It's now very easy for me to entertain the thought that I may be 
wrong even when I feel pretty strongly that I'm right.  Even if I've 
been quite forceful about something I believe, I'm able to back down 
very quickly in the face of contradicting evidence.  I have no 
embarrassment about admitting that I was wrong about something.</p>
<p>That all came from decades of working in a discipline that 
mercilessly proves you to be mistaken a dozen times a day, but that also
 requires you to believe you're right if you're going to make any 
progress at all.</p>
<p><strong>[bignose]</strong> This discipline is much more native to the
 scientific method, of course: coming up with a solution is easy, it's 
not until there is solid <strong>evidence</strong>, demonstrating the solution in the face of <strong>attempts to disprove</strong>
 it, that it's of any value. I see this convergence as a sign that 
programming is finally becoming enough of a science that blind faith is 
beginning to be seen for the nonsensical position that it is.</p>
<p><strong>[Robert Rossney]</strong>  I disagree in several respects, not least in that it doesn't really have much to do with what I was describing.  </p>
<p>The practice of open-mindedness that I'm talking about is orthogonal 
to understanding the universe through controlled repetition.  There are 
people to whom the experience of feeling wrong, and the action of openly
 admitting error, are unpleasant, even intolerable.  Remaining open to 
that experience, even embracing it, is a practice that is more spiritual
 than scientific.  </p>
<p>Sure, the best scientists have to cultivate this ability too in order
 to withstand the emotional process of investigation.  But plenty of 
scientists don't (which is why we know who Thomas Kuhn was), and plenty 
of people who aren't scientists do.</p>
<p>And I vigorously reject the idea that we're somehow suddenly seeing 
that blind faith is nonsensical.  Find me a software developer who's 
willing to stand up for blind faith.  What we're not willing to say is 
that what we are doing is often engaging in faith, and that it this 
faith is sometimes blind.</p>

                <p>Well to be a successful developer, you have to think 
about the problem before you try to solve it.  I've taken this approach 
to projects around the house, and have found that doing the proper 
research, you can learn how to do many tasks, that might have previously
 seemed daunting.  I applied this lesson to carpentry, and have done 
some room additions, I wouldn't have thought possible.  Programming also
 requires attention to detail, and that is also a good trait to carry 
over into other aspects of your life.</p>

                <p>I now tend to think of everything as objects so now 
when my wife throws an exception I simply catch it and deal with it and 
move on.</p>
<p>Sometimes though it's an exception I wasn't expecting which is the 
nature of exceptions after all. Life simply stops working until I go 
over the same ground again and again looking for the previous erroneous 
statement which the debugger (in this case my wife) is unable to 
accurately express. The replies I receieve often leads me up the garden 
path and around the trees until I spot my mistake and correct it and try
 again.</p>

                <p>This is not a habit, however it's a real life example
 of practical implementation of computer theory (thanks, Don K, for the 
great books you've written :)</p>
<p>Army service (there are countries where it is obligatory, you know), 
and I and a mate are faced with ~1200 soldier cards that must be sorted 
by yesterday by captain's orders. Thankfully, the key was a 6-digit 
number. The mate was worried how long it would take, but I had Vol.2 
fresh in my mind :)</p>
<p>So I made ten stacks for digits 0-9, and I divided the cards based on the <em>last</em> digit. Packed them, repeated for the <em>second-to-last</em> digit. And so on.</p>
<p>The procedure took about 30 minutes with a steady pace, and then we 
sat and had a relaxed, calm time. Obviously (for everyone who's been in 
an army), when the captain dropped by about 4 hours later ready to start
 shouting, we said, "oh, we <em>just</em> finished."</p>

 rude and impolite comments for those looking for help on simple

for, only that they need help and that if I were in their position I 
would really appreciate some guidance</p>

              What many people mistake for unfriendliness is rather 
succinctness and a wish for the asker to learn for themselves.  Give me a
 hint as to where to go, not the answer on a silver platter, and I'll 
remember it for next time.  This, of course, frustrates people who do 
not wish to learn something in the first place, which is a condition 
that we sometimes mistakenly believe to be non-existant. - <b> Xiong Chiamiov</b>

                <p>I'm not sure it affects my daily life in this way, 
but it gives me a vocabulary.  I look at the way my boss uses his 
computer.  He seems to be an event consumer.  He watches the screen 
until it enters a state where it is waiting for him to respond, then he 
provides the requested data.  His work gets done deterministically in 
the order it is started (He uses a priority queue.)  He's got one big 
mutex, and if its locked, well, you can try again later.</p>
<p>I am an event producer.  I fill the computers buffers with requests 
to process as quickly as i think of them.  If one consumer becomes full,
 I'll asynchronously continue to add requests to other consumers.  Work 
gets completed, but not in any particular order.  My interrupt handling 
routines are a bit buggy, so sometimes, when work gets added, the 
current process segfaults.</p>
<p>This gives rise to one of our most frequent conversations "How are 
you working with so many programs open?" (him) and "How do you get 
anything done with just one program open?" (me)</p>

                <p>Test-driven development, specifically, has gotten me 
in the habit of thinking about the desired end before I start, and 
focusing on outcomes rather than processes.  This has helped me 
tremendously in many areas.</p>
<p>General project management has helped me with prioritization and tackling large problems.</p>
<p>Programming has helped me think more clearly about things, and less 
vaguely, while still giving me the ability to think about appropriate 
abstractions.</p>

                <p>Programming in combination with stackoverflow (and 
other forums) taught me to try and word my problem in a way that 
somebody else can understand it. It happens often enough that I go to 
stackoverflow, a forum or even start typing a message on MSN to a 
friend, and halfway through my question I suddenly realize the answer.</p>
<p>Thinking back I definitely have used this method in real life in the 
past, maybe not always by writing it down but by asking myself how I 
would explain the situation to (say) my girlfriend.  It helps.</p>

                <p>For me the opposite of this is true. Programming has brought very few good habits to my everyday life. But my every day life is <strong>constantly</strong>
 bringing good (and sometimes bad) habits to my programming. For 
example, I used to be the worst programmer in the world when it came to 
comments. I found it was largely because I tend to be a very unorganized
 person, but as soon as I forced myself to be more organized in my every
 day life (taking better care of the bills, keeping the house, 
especially my desk, clean) the benefits to my code were noticeable 
immediately.</p>

                <p>Problem analysis has been a big one- breaking the big
 problem into smaller ones, eliminate variables wherever possible- I use
 all of this the whole time in my horsemanship and in pretty much every 
other facet of my life.</p>
<p>Also I've become much more aware of the value of creating tools to 
support a project rather than just focussing on the project itself and 
the value of maybe paying for something that will make the work I need 
to do a lot easier.</p>
