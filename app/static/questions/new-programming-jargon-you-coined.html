          <h3>Question</h3>
<p>What programming terms have you coined that have taken off in your own circles (i.e. have heard others repeat it)? It might be within your own team, workplace or garnered greater popularity on the Internet.</p>
<h3>Directions</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Write your programming term, word or phrase <strong>in bold text</strong> followed by an explanation, citation and/or usage example so we can use it in appropriate context.</p></li>
<li><p>Don't repeat common jargon already ingrained in the programming culture like: <em>kludge</em>, <em>automagically</em>, <em>cruft</em>, etc. (unless you coined it).</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>Background</h3>
<p>This question serves in the spirit of communication among programmers through sharing of terminology with each other, to benefit us by its propagation within our own teams and environments.</p>
<hr />
<p>Stealing from the comments: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"A shared vocabulary is the basis of
  communication, not just among
  programmers <em>[...]</em>"</p>

                    Part of jargon taking off is exposure which it certainly receives here. Just working over the weekend, one of these terms has already started taking effect in our team (just happened to sync with what we&#39;re doing). However I won&#39;t say which one because I don&#39;t want to show faves. Jargon will take off or die on its own merit. Very useful regardless. - <b> John K</b>

It also meets reqs of what <i>not</i> to ask: * subjective (your jargon is not subjective), * argumentative (personal jargon cannot be argued), or require extended discussion (no more of a discussion thread than your dictionary!).

About seeing this kind of question on the front page, you can use the sub-tab &quot;newest&quot; and you won&#39;t see any older questions. By default the Question homepage shows activity.

              This is actually quite a common idiom on languages that use == and =.  If you put a constant on the LHS of the expression the compiler will generate an error if you use = accidentally rather than == for equality checking.  Quite a few C or C++ programming types actually recommend doing this, and the principle would apply to C# or Java as well. - <b> ConcernedOfTunbridgeWells</b>

              ... I&#39;ve read books which actually suggest this, since - in some languages - an assignment statement can be used as a condition. So if you&#39;re in the habit of writing <code>(4==$foo)</code> when the day comes that you bugger up and write <code>(4=foo)</code> you&#39;ll get an error message telling you what you messed up.

              This is not a problem for Java--it was designed to avoid stupid mistakes rather than force people to come up with stupid ways to work around them.

              I pity the poor &quot;Yoda Conditions&quot; programmer that has to compare two variables. Oh noes, &quot;if (x == y)&quot;, nothing can help me prevent accidental assignment in an if statement anymore! There are good ways to avoid accidental assignments (compiler warnings, code reviews, unit tests, code coverage), and writing your code backwards isn&#39;t one of them. Even more annoying is: &quot;if (3 &lt;= x)&quot;, no chance for the bug but they still persist writing it backwards. - <b> Jon</b>

              Yoda condition necessary is, because C++ shortcomings has. Yoda condition is used to bend the C++ compiler into emitting an error if you forget an = sign: 

if (2 = x)

illegal is, while

if (x = 2)

a legal statement is, but not certainly what you mean.
Java wiped this clear allowing a boolean between brackets, rather than an expression. The sintax is strong with this language and Yoda programming is for those who do not perceive the change in the force - <b> mico</b>

              This is not Yoda speak. Yoda speaks in Object Subject Verb order. So Yoda would say &quot;(5 count ==)&quot; not &quot;(5 == count)&quot;. It would be more accurate to call this Klingon speak, as that is the order they use. - <b> user102008</b>

                <p>Different kinds of bug reports:</p>
<p><strong>Smug Report</strong> - a bug submitted by a user who thinks he knows a lot more about the system's design than he really does.  Filled with irrelevant technical details and one or more suggestions (always wrong) about what he thinks is causing the problem and how we should fix it.</p>
<p><strong>Drug Report</strong> - a report so utterly incomprehensible that whoever submitted it must have been smoking crack.  The lesser version is a <em>chug report</em>, where the submitter is thought to have had one too many.</p>
<p><strong>Shrug Report</strong> - a bug report with no error message or repro steps and only a vague description of the problem.  Usually contains the phrase "doesn't work."</p>

              It is true that the smug reporter is often better than the other two.  Nevertheless, the term fits them well (and is funny).  I&#39;ve seen some truly bizarre explanations for how problems work from &quot;smug&quot; reports.  The other types tend to be just completely useless. - <b> jsight</b>

              Yup; smug reports are sometimes helpful. Smug reports where the person disassembles your code in .NET reflector and actually finds the fix for your bug are best of all (though a bit disconcerting). - <b> Fraser</b>

              @Robert, if the report is precise and technically accurate then by definition it&#39;s not a smug report. It&#39;s amusing to see some people contending that the definition itself is incorrect or unfair because there are certain cases that don&#39;t fit the definition. An apple is not really a fruit because sometimes it might be a zucchini. - <b> Aaronaught</b>

              I once reported a vulnerability in Wordpress and everyone on the dev team accused me of &quot;smoking crack&quot; and didn&#39;t even bother using my exploit.

                <p><strong>A Duck</strong></p>
<p>A feature added for no other reason than to draw management attention and be removed, thus avoiding unnecessary changes in other aspects of the product.</p>
<p>I don't know if I actually <em>invented</em> this term or not, but I am certainly not the originator of the story that spawned it.</p>
<p>This started as a piece of Interplay corporate lore.  It was well known that producers (a game industry position, roughly equivalent to PMs) had to make a change to everything that was done.  The assumption was that subconsciously they felt that if they didn't, they weren't adding value.</p>
<p>The artist working on the queen animations for Battle Chess was aware of this tendency, and came up with an innovative solution.  He did the animations for the queen the way that he felt would be best, with one addition:  he gave the queen a pet duck.  He animated this duck through all of the queen's animations, had it flapping around the corners.  He also took great care to make sure that it never overlapped the "actual" animation.</p>
<p>Eventually, it came time for the producer to review the animation set for the queen.  The producer sat down and watched all of the animations.  When they were done, he turned to the artist and said, "that looks great.  Just one thing - get rid of the duck."</p>

              I had a Brazilian friend tell me of a similar concept years ago, but in a business context.  Farmers used to drive a sacrificial head of cattle into a river to test for/satisfy any piranha that were present.    The business world co-opted the Portuguese word &quot;Boi&quot; (cattle) to describe a deliberately  allowed mistake in a report so that critics would find it and hence take the heat off the rest of the work.   However in being an engineer I find it hard to do such things! - <b> Peter M</b>

              I saw a similar &quot;duck&quot; idea on The Daily WTF. There was a loop that did nothing for 10000000 or so iterations. It was there so when the coder wasn&#39;t able to produce anything that management would understand, they could remove a 0 from the iteration number and tell management that they found a place in the code that they optimized by an order of magnitude. - <b> Dinah</b>

              Another note: this isn&#39;t unique to programming.  When I used to work construction, many guys would leave obvious mistakes in their work so that when inspection time came, the inspector would feel satisfied with himself and leave them with something easy to fix.  The rationale was that no matter how perfect everything was done, the inspector had to find <i>something</i> before they&#39;d sign off. - <b> TM.</b>

                <p><strong>Stringly Typed</strong></p>
<p>A riff on <em>strongly typed</em>.  Used to describe an implementation that needlessly relies on strings when programmer &amp; refactor friendly options are available.  </p>
<p>For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Method parameters that take strings when other more appropriate types should be used</li>
<li>On the occasion that a string is required in a method call (e.g. network service), the string is then passed and used throughout the rest of the call graph without first converting it to a more suitable internal representation (e.g. parse it and create an enum, then you have strong typing throughout the rest of your codebase).</li>
<li>Message passing without using typed messages etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>Excessively stringly typed code is usually a pain to understand and detonates at runtime with errors that the compiler would normally find.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong></p>
<p>Person 1: "Did you check out Jimmy's API?"</p>
<p>Person 2: "Yeah, what a mess.  It's so hard to understand and it always fails at runtime in an obscure fashion because it's <em>Stringly Typed</em> from top to bottom."  </p>

              Everyone who took C filesystems class at my school ran into this over and over, when forgetting to put \n on a printf statement. Then adding another printf statement later in the code to debug, which has a \n, and flushes the buffer, causing the appearance that a ton of code suddenly started working, when it really had been before but not printing. - <b> Nick Lewis</b>

              I once had a bug of this variety due to SQL Server&#39;s query optimization: in the SELECT portion of the query, there was an operation being performed that was illegal for some of the rows in a given table.  These rows weren&#39;t supposed to be returned from the query, but after much frustrating searching I realized that the optimizer must&#39;ve been pre-processing the SELECT portion of the query for likely results before finding out for sure whether a given row was actually going to be output... and hence crashing on these bad rows when it thought they should be a part of the result.

              I had one function returning bool missing the return statement, but the last value used was the one that should have been returned.

              @tloflin If you don&#39;t specify a doctype in IE6/IE7/IE8, you will get horribly-broken-beyond-any-hope-quirksmode, while if you specify the doctype but have invalid markup, you&#39;ll simply get quirksmode.  The difference is that in horribly-broken mode, you&#39;ll have considerably more work to do to make the HTML really compliant.

For example, take a legacy web application designed for IE6 without a doctype, add a doctype to it, and see how the pages layout suddenly abominably breaks because of the upgrade from &quot;horribly-broken-quirksmode&quot; to &quot;quirksmode&quot; - <b> ckarras</b>

              We have a similar term - &quot;Jimmy Fixed&quot; named after an intern we had working at our company. It&#39;s where you haven&#39;t actually fixed something, but claim it is fixed.

The alternative definition is the bug is fixed, but only in one specific case.

              Humans weren&#39;t build with a process that already included abstract language and technical designs, and didn&#39;t converse with their creators about it in that way. However, expressions like &quot;gene pool&quot; are now common, and of course medical descriptions are full of it. Or just &quot;my blood sugar is low.&quot; Having said that, I just like the idea of giving the language a flavor by putting twist on it. So the emotional center is an &#39;emygdala&#39; and an important component is a TOMcat = Theory of Mind Catalog, that tries to predict what others will do. - <b> Stanislav</b>

              In object-oriented design, I always thought of ravioli code as a good thing; everything is encapsulated and none of the components are too big. Lasagna code (a bad thing) is the opposite extreme from spaghetti code: everything is handled in a single monolithic God Object. - <b> Taymon</b>

              A Schroedinbug is <b>not</b> <i>&quot;a problem that some people see when they look and others can&#39;t find at all.&quot;</i>  It refers to a function/feature that appears to fluctuate between buggy and correct (like Schr&#246;dinger&#39;s cat fluctuating between alive and dead), until somebody looks at the source code (opens the box), at which point it becomes permanently bugged.  It&#39;s a fun term but it&#39;s definitely not a new one. - <b> Aaronaught</b>

              <div class="comment">
              Although i&#39;m ambivalent about the definition of Schroedinbug, In the original thought experiment, the cat does not fluctuate between two states, but is actually superposed, being in both states simultaneously, until someone opens the box and looks, at which point (and never sooner) the cat must choose between being dead or alive, with probability equal to the radioactive decay of some atomic nucleus elsewhere in the device. - <b> TokenMacGuy</b>

                <p><strong>Smurf Naming Convention</strong> </p>
<p>When almost every class has the same prefix. IE, when a user clicks on the button, a SmurfAccountView passes a SmurfAccountDTO to the SmurfAccountController. The SmurfID is used to fetch a SmurfOrderHistory which is passed to the SmurfHistoryMatch before forwarding to either SmurfHistoryReviewView or SmurfHistoryReportingView. If a SmurfErrorEvent occurs it is logged by SmurfErrorLogger to ${app}/smurf/log/smurf/smurflog.log</p>

Not only does it force people to think enough to phrase the question well, but apparently a lot of them walk away with the answer without consulting anyone other than the stuffed bear. - <b> ZoFreX</b>

              @ZoFreX that is Allan Turing&#39;s bear! that he talked to just like the OP talked to his duck.   If you ever gaze upon this bear you must bow in honor of its limitless powers of reasoning and induction. - <b> Rook</b>

                <p><strong>Baseball Exception Handling</strong> This is a pattern wherein when application logic is implemented via a deeply nested set of try/catch/throw blocks. Specific application logic is implemented in catch blocks and correct program behavior depends on exceptions being thrown at the right time. In the canonical example, the throwing and catching happens within a single, very long, method.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code>try
{
    // 10-1000 lines of code
    if (someCondition)
         throw new SomeConditionException();

    // 10-1000 lines of code
    if (someOtherCondition)
         throw new SomeOtherConditionException();

}
catch (SomeConditionException)
{
    // 10-1000 lines of code, preferably with nested baseball exception handling
}
catch (SomeOtherConditionException)
{
    // 10-1000 lines of code, preferably with nested baseball exception handling
}
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Advanced Baseball Exception Handling</strong> The same as Baseball Exception Handling but with the addition of added state held in the Exception class so that the catch block can logically branch based on where the throw was. This is useful when a single Exception type is used but catch logic needs to know where in the process it was thrown from.</p>
<pre><code>try
{
    // 10-1000 lines of code
    if (someCondition)
         throw new SomeConditionException("early in the process");

    // 10-1000 lines of code
    if (someCondition)
         throw new SomeConditionException("late in the process");

}
catch (SomeConditionException e)
{
    // execute shared logic

    if (e.State == "early in the process")
         // execute early in the process logic

    if (e.State == "late in the process")
         // execute late in the process logic
}
</code></pre>

              At a former job we dealt with multiple terabytes of data on a monthly basis, so I often had to download rather large files (hundreds of megabytes or more) to my development machine.  You know how IE refuses to actually put the file where you want it, but first downloads it to cache and then copies it?  You know how it pops up a dialog, including a cancel button, while it copies the file to the target location?  You know how that cancel button has focus, so any keyboard input triggers it?

              The sad part is there are GUI toolboxes (GTK+ being a notorious one) where clicking a widget lightly, on a slow machine, makes it focus (so the computer noticed the click!) but not actually activate/click. You need to click harder (longer) for it to work. What&#39;s worse, if you tap on a touchpad, you can&#39;t tap &quot;longer&quot; because it won&#39;t register at all. So you must use the &quot;mouse keys&quot; instead... argh. - <b> SF.</b>

When you have something that fails on the 500th pass through the loop due to something that went wrong before it&#39;s easier to run off a big logfile and look it over--that way when you find where it blew up you can look backwards and see how it got there. - <b> Loren Pechtel</b>

              @Matthew Kane Yes, I&#39;ve had to do quite a lot of carpet logging myself, and I hate it.  Sometimes it&#39;s inevitable, although I learnt the hard way that you CAN have too much logging.  On one system I was working on,  I put a debug level log statement after almost every line.  There was a lot of redundancy.  This code went on production.  Once, to resolve a bug, we enabled the debug level to see what was happening.  The system could not cope with the amount of logging being generated and died horribly. Lessons:  1)DO have debug level logs,  but minimise redundant info. 2)Use a good log library. - <b> Il-Bhima</b>

<p>If you don't have a "generic toolbox" class and don't tolerate functions outside a class or a namespace, you sometimes attach simple, generic, stateless functions like "dec2hex", "crc16file" or "JSONtimestamp"  to a specialized class because that class often uses them or they somewhat resemble its functionality, but you often call them from other classes (which don't need the "host" class for any other purpose).</p>

              @Andrew: a classic utility method is usually attached to a utility class.

              In a non-obligatory-oop (object Pascal) or semi-oop (C++) language, the idea that this should have been in a class would be ludicrous to some people, and an article of faith to others.

              The Obfuscated Perl Contest was held annually between 1996 and 2000. Anyway, Perl is an artist&#39;s language, it gives you the tools, it doesn&#39;t force you to do things in one way. There&#39;s more than one way to do it, is a Perl motto. You can write obfuscated code very hard to read or you can write clean, succinct and beautiful code.

<p>Not really sure if I'm the first to use this, but I got into the habit of describing the process of negating a logical expression as "banging" it. This refers to the "!" symbol, used in some languages to denote logical negation, and the word "bang", a synonym for the exclamation mark symbol.</p>

<p>Dev1: What's wrong with my expression? It's doing the exact opposite of what I want.</p>

<p>At a previous company, we generally built two versions of any product that ran on the Boss's computer. One "real" version which was shipped to customers, and one "boss build" which reflected the endless list of font, color, size, and placement tweaks that came every several days from the corner office.</p>

                <p><strong>Encraption</strong> - Really insecure encryption, which gives management the illusion that the code is securing sensitive data, but in reality isn't.</p>
<p>For example, management has a requirement that user IDs and passwords (eg, for database access) must be encrypted within the server configuration files. However, the data files containing potentially sensitive info (eg, SSNs, driver license numbers, bank account numbers, etc.) are stored in unencrypted plaintext form on the server.</p>
<p>Obviously, if network security were ever compromised and the server was hacked into, the hackers wouldn't bother trying to decrypt the user-IDs and passwords, because they have instant access to the real data in the clear.</p>

<p>Term to describe insane nesting of data in various formats, usually stored inside a relational database. Hence creating an abomination resembling the stuffing of a chicken inside of a duck inside of a turkey.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<p>A database text-column containing a list of pipe-delimited name/value pairs with the values being PHP objects as serialized strings.</p>
<pre><code>SELECT options FROM filterfield WHERE id = 123;
</code></pre>
<p>yields</p>
<pre><code>foo=bar|options=a:4:{i:0;a:2:{s:5:"title";s:13:"Kids + Family";s:7:"options";s:128:"Amusement Parks...
</code></pre>
<p>Another example is how several wordpress plugins store their configuration options as serialized PHP array in the "wp_options" table.</p>

<p>To see an example of this, take some well-written polymorphic code, remove all the derived classes, and put a state bag in the base class that holds all information that used to live in the derived classes. For extra points, store the state bag as an XML string.  </p>

                <p><strong>Agent</strong>.  I didn't actually invent it, Carl Grundstrom did.  We were discussing what to call the little programs that were part of "Security Toolkit/UNIX" version 2.0, that would rattle around a UNIX system (remember UNIX?) and decide how securely it was configured.  I said something about the program being a spy, and Carl jumped to Secret Agent, then Agent.  This was early 1992, and I haven't seen any earlier references to agent-based computing, which is really common NOW.  </p>

                <p><strong>Sonic</strong> - A manager who is so clued out that you wonder if he's actually plugged into the same reality you are.</p>
<p>The name stems from a passage by Douglas Adams where he goes on at length about how certain kinds of madness should be easy to sort out.  The provided example was someone who thought he was a hedgehog, a form of madness that was ostensibly easy to point out the flaw in: "Here's a mirror.  Here's a photo of a hedgehog.  You sort out the difference."</p>
<p>A Sonic (named after the video game hedgehog) is someone who'd take the mirror, take the picture and say "Yep, that's me alright!"</p>

                <p><strong>Brute force programming</strong></p>
<p>When a (generally clueless) "programmer" tries every sequence possible and imaginable of instructions and blocks of code in order to get a working program that does (or seems to do) what have been asked. After a few hundred iterations, they manage to get more or less a working solution and call it finished.</p>
<p>I teach some Computer Science classes, and this term is specially applicable to those undergrad students who managed to get into a CS course, but really do not have aptitude to be computer scientists at all. They lack the abstraction skills to understand how a program is written.</p>

              @Randy and @Bart. Well, this is not a MySQL replace. Delsert deletes all previous entries and populates with new entries; it does not &quot;replace&quot; anything per se. For example, lets say on Decemeber 31st 2010, you have two list of cars in a lot, 2010 cars (in stock) and 2011 cars (coming in on January 1st 2011.) You cannot sell 2010 cars as new on that date, so you delete ALL 2010 cars from the new-car database and replace them with 2011 cars. You are not replacing but doing something like an upsert involving deletion. Ignoring the lack of grace of the example, do you get the point? - <b> Phil</b>

<p>So, unbeknown to our boss, we changed the word from Fail to Bail, and then because we already used Bail when we wanted to 'Bail out' of somewhere, it was changed to Basil.</p>
<p>This went through a few of our sub-companies, and also through companies who ex-employees joined and now we refer to a 'Fail' as a 'Basil'...</p>

The nightmare case of this in our office is a 9k lines Java class with 5 methods containing regions of some hundred lines copy pasted all over it. </p>

                <p><strong>"It Compiled"</strong></p>
<p><em>A defense you supply in jest when someone points out an obvious mistake in your code.</em></p>
<p>It's reference to a former employee who was the sort of programmer that people talk about for decades after. This programmer submitted for final review some extensive changes to a core application, which due to some serious bugs he had introduced, failed to even launch.</p>
<p>When confronted about the results of his testing prior to submitting his code, he looked confused for a second, and then responded, "well, <em>it compiled</em>." Apparently the struggle he underwent with the compiler to get his code to even build was so extensive that he assumed that he had fixed all of his bugs when it finally actually compiled.</p>

<p>You know what spaghetti code is.  Sometimes in badly written OO code, there are so many short methods of only a few lines, but only a convoluted path of execution challenging to follow, weaving in and out of various classes.  It's like with spaghetti except the pieces are much shorter.   </p>

                <p><strong>TIN Loop</strong> - a situation that arises when a programmer makes an attempt to fix a bug by guessing what the cause might be, declares the bug fixed without verifying, and tells the user to "try it now."  ("TIN" is short for <em>Try It Now</em>.)  Invariably, the user will encounter the bug again and report it to the programmer, who will proceed with the next half-assed guess of a fix, thus repeating the same scenario.</p>
<p>A more specific version of the term is the <strong>n-order TIN Loop</strong>, where <em>n</em> is the number of "try it now" iterations.</p>

<p>A Snergle is a practice followed or advocated by a developer with little understanding of that practice, simply because the developer in question does not want to admit their lack of understanding.  "If I don't understand it, it must be good.  If I use it a lot, I'll sound smart."</p>
<p>The Snergle is an application of a practice, not the practice itself.  Maybe applications of design patterns are in fact snergles, but this does not mean that all applications of design patterns are snergles.</p>
<p>Snergles are different from Cargo Cults in that a Cargo Cult mistakenly believes it understands what it is doing.  A Snergle is the result of someone that <em>knows</em> they do not understand the concept, and assumes that means it must have value.</p>
<p>Example:  "Why in the world do we have a StringFactory class that takes a string as a parameter?  Someone must have been snergling hard."</p>

                <p><strong>Confuckuration</strong></p>
<p>When you have a framework or software which actually can do a lot but won't do anything if you don't set up everything properly in thousands of lines of deeply nested XML code (often in one single file, in .NET projects the <code>App.config</code> file).  </p>
<p><img src="http://t2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn%3afvPCOR91IQGDvM" alt="Deeply nested Config File" /><br />
Usually you're just able to validate the XML syntax/format but not the configuration logic behind (interrelations etc.) so having a typo in one of dozens cross-referencing configuration items (<code>string</code> keys which might contain whole namespaces) will cause the software just to "not do the expected", but without failure.</p>

                <p><strong>OutOfLinebreaksException</strong>: <em>Linebreaks for Loader.php exhausted. die() has been disabled for your convenience.</em></p>
<p>This is a very specific one, so I imagine no one can actually relate, but it was gleeful amounts of utter, raw despair for me, hence sharing:</p>
<h2>The Story</h2>
<p>The PHP Parser is a robust creature that rarely hiccups.</p>
<p>Except when it does.</p>
<p>This is a once-in-a-lifetime occurrence. Apparently I have two lives, because I've observed it getting its knickers in a twist twice now. Let me tell you about the second time.</p>
<p>PHP usually ignores indentation whitespace and blank lines between code blocks - but somehow, when we were updating Zend 1.9.7 to 1.10.3, half our PHP Unit tests broke. I made a copy of the offending file (Loader.php in Zend's autoloading sublibrary), placed the old code in, commented the new code out and was about to sequentially comment back in to find the core of the error when I noticed <strong>it was still happening</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>I did a diff.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>The only difference was in comments</em>. I didn't even want to believe it, so I asked two other people to look at the diff and find the programmatic difference for me. They confirmed a lack thereof. I still felt my sanity slowly leaving me.</p>
<ul>
<li>I checked the file with a hex editor.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>No</em> broken UTF-8 characters. Well-formed through-out.</p>
<ul>
<li>I took out the comments.</li>
</ul>
<p>Suddenly it worked again. Cue first manic, despair-driven cackling!</p>
<p>To cut a long story short, I 'narrowed it down' to the amount of linebreaks in the file (without the help of <code>die()</code> which didn't quite want to work in that file anymore). The old file would break just the same if you put more that ~two more linebreaks into it.</p>
<p>To cut to the chase: To this day we don't know what caused it. Suhosin patch? No. xdebug? No. Suhosin extension? No. PHP core? Apparently no, except that's the only thing left to 'explain' it. (Same PHP version on Ubuntu/Kubuntu/CentOS was showing the error, but it wasn't doing it on OpenSUSE; we're not sure if it was the OS or their respective package doing it.)</p>
<p>Our project internal wiki documented the mess and this is (paraphrased) the 'Solution' section:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Depending on your definition of 'solution':</p>
<ul>
<li>There is none</li>
<li>Zend 1.10.4</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="http://pandora.pinkgothic.com/out-of-linebreaks-exception.jpg" rel="nofollow">
So we had the Exception on our Whiteboard for a while
</a>
<sup style="font-size:9px">[1]</sup>. Much amusement ensued.</p>
<h2>The term</h2>
<p>Whenever a parser of an interpreted language hiccups, for whatever reason, and elements of the source file that should not matter suddenly do, despite well-formed syntax and no broken characters, any observed changes in logic are to be considered the result of an <strong>OutOfLinebreaksException</strong>.</p>
<p>(Even if it has nothing to do with linebreaks in that particular parser-tripping-over-itself case.)</p>

                <p><strong>Bob</strong></p>
<p>This one's kind of narrow, because it is specific to interpreted scripting languages that don't have decent debuggers in which you can set breakpoints.  Specifically, it came up at my last job where we used Stata a lot.  I got in the habit of deliberately inserting a syntax error into my code wherever I needed a breakpoint.  Usually, I just added the word "bob," which was quick to type, and unlikely to be recognized as a command name.  It can be used as a verb, as in "bob that function after you load the data--I want to have a look at it before we do anything to it."</p>
<p>The practice caught on, and soon everyone was using "bob" to add breakpoints.  Unfortunately, they weren't always as conscientious as I was about removing the "bob"s when they were done debugging.  This gave rise to</p>
<p><strong>Scraping Dan off the ceiling</strong></p>
<p>Which had to be done every time I tried to run the build and it broke because someone on my team had left behind an errant "bob."  Also known as "reaping what you sow."</p>

                <p>[variable/function/feature/API] has a <strong>Schizophrenia</strong> - when it tries to be two contradictory things at once (usually due to a design error - you refactored half of the project with new meaning of the piece in mind, while keeping the other working)</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>In soft-typed languages when the variable can appear as two different types - say, an index in a table of values and a reference to a function returning a similar value.</li>
<li>an API that tries to protect users from shooting themselves in the foot while aiming at maximum freedom for the user.</li>
<li>a variable that holds a value that only coincidentally works in two places, e.g. a database index and file line number.</li>
<li>a variable that is written to with two different formats of the same data, e.g. an array of 1-byte integers, or an ASCII string containing the values as CSV text.</li>
<li>a flag that does two remotely similar things at once, e.g. "isStopped" which is set both when the system finalizes a total emergency stop and when it is momentarily idle and ready to change work mode.</li>
<li>a "unit" difference, say x and y in px but height and width in mm.</li>
<li>a GUI API that can't make its mind about using x,y,w,h and x1,x2,y1,y2</li>
<li>a function that can return an error code, value of which lies within legal valid return values.</li>

<p>These are n-tier pseudo-architectures.  Super pipelines are methods that call methods that call method, etc, and the intervening methods don't actually do anything except call the next method.  Ziggurates are classes that inherit from classes that inherit from classes that inherit from classes and the middle classes don't actually do anything.</p>

<p><strong>FM</strong> as in f***ing magic</p>
<p><strong>FM</strong> is a name given to processes during early analysis and design where we know what must go in and what is supposed to come out but, as yet, have no idea of how the process is supposed to make such a transformation.</p>
<p>Once we had a trainer come into our shop to give a workshop on a particular design methodology. The trainer must have overheard us refering to <strong>FM</strong> quite a bit and decided to use it in the workshop as an example of a process that we might be working on. It really cracked us up - the trainer had no idea what it stood for.</p>

                <p><strong>Experimental programming</strong> - Arranging tokens with little or no understanding what they really mean, and testing if the resulting code works well or not. This is repeated until the code works.</p>

<sup style="font-size:9px">[1]</sup>.</p>
<p>Sometimes this can be a valid technique, provided the testing is done well. Once case I use it is when doing a vector cross product, as I never remember what is the orientation of the result. I try it one way, if it does not work, then try the second one.</p>
<p>If the tests are automated and fully cover the required functionality, I think this is a valid special case of test driven development - with TDD you do not need to care what the code is and where it came from, as long as it passes.</p>

We came up with this expression in the demoscene in the mid-90s when we had to rework parts of our demos and were sure that the existing code would trip us up rather than help us. We also argued that rewriting the effects made you learn them properly rather than relying on cut'n'paste for the more advanced stuff (mathematics, pointer voodoo etc).</p>
<p><em>There might have been a reference to cocaine use and staying up all night (the latter being a natural consequence of the Björn Borg principle). Before you do a Björn Borg you have to actually shout "Björn Borg!", also for reasons I can't quite remember. Maybe as a warning/invitation to veto.</em></p>

              It&#39;s ugly - especially if you have to combine a <code>const_cast</code> with it. OTOH it explicitely states what you mean, which is good, as casting in C++ is more complicated than in C. For consistency it doesn&#39;t make much sense to allow C-style casts for &quot;easy cases&quot; and require the others for &quot;the rest&quot;. - <b> peterchen</b>

              We used a similar term for otherwise skilled engineers who were tasked with excruciating data entry.

We use a big horrible &quot;database&quot; application.  I quote the term because it was so unstable that the owners do not allow any programmatic access.  Data entry is manual, and only a few people know how to get any information out of it.

I had all of our group&#39;s data in a MS Access database of my own design.  I spent two days writing a script that translated the data to the new format, about 1 second to run it, and then four engineers typed for two months.  &quot;SLATE Monkeys&quot;. - <b> mbmcavoy</b>

<p>In a database, this is <em>the</em> view that consolidates data across most or all of the database through numerous joins to other views, subviews, and tables.  It is often used for reporting purposes or to transform data into a reporting structure.  If you were ever to encounter the 260 table query limit, it would likely be through executing a query against this.  </p>

              There is a deeply rooted belief among the programmers: if the program after major changes compiles at first try without a single warning, and the program seems to work correctly at the first try, Be Afraid, Be Very Afraid.

                <p><strong>Hudson Moment</strong> - A moment of panic/distress that occurs during the realization that a project has become woefully doomed to a horrible fate.  It typically involves a wild verbal rant and complete loss of morale.  This moment usually ends when a nearby coworker suggests a way out of it and somebody else says, "Knock it off Hudson!" </p>
<p>Taken from the scene in the movie "Aliens" where Private Hudson freaks out and starts yelling:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Ripley</strong>: How long after we're declared overdue can we expect a rescue? </p>
<p><strong>Hicks</strong>: [pause] Seventeen days. </p>
<p><strong>Hudson</strong>: Seventeen <em>days?</em> Hey man, I don't wanna rain on your parade, but we're not gonna last seventeen <em>hours!</em> Those things are gonna come in here just like they did before. And they're gonna come in here...<br />
<strong>Ripley</strong>: Hudson!<br />
<strong>Hudson</strong>: ...and they're gonna come in here AND THEY'RE GONNA GET US!</p>
<p><strong>Ripley</strong>: <em>Hudson!</em> This little girl survived longer than that with no weapons and no training.  [to Newt] </p>
<p><strong>Ripley</strong>: Right?  [Newt apes a salute] </p>
<p><strong>Hudson</strong>: Why don't you put her in charge?  </p>

                <p><strong>Line noise:</strong> The syntax of the Perl programming language, or almost any program written in Perl. (I think one of my co-workers coined this.)</p>
<p><strong>Siesta:</strong> The point at around 1:00 - 2:00 in the afternoon, when your PC suddenly becomes unresponsive for 10-30 minutes. May be a surprise clean build triggered by eclipse, quirky windows behavior from network latency, or simply a CPU-intensive background process. More broadly, any time the computer is unresponsive to user input, because it's taking a nap.</p>
<p>Used by myself and my cubemates.</p>
<p><strong>Traished:</strong> Inexplicably hosed, for no logical reason. Unable to compile, or produce an intelligible error output. Non-reproducible compiler behavior.</p>
<p>Not mine; came from summer camp, when learning to program. One of my classmates got an error from his Pascal compiler, saying:</p>
<p><em>This error should never occur. If it does, the file variable has somehow been traished.</em></p>
<p>The typo was included in the compiler error message. He discovered, after much trial and error and consulting with the lab instructor, that he was missing the period which is required after <em>END</em> to terminate a pascal program. Once he got it to compile, he was no longer able to reproduce the compiler error.</p>

<p>invented by me (circa 1999 while working at EA)</p>
<p>A term used to define </p>
<ul>
<li>the uncertain completeness or efficiency of a piece of code </li>
<li>the incomplete design of a feature </li>
<li>the (in)accuracy of an estimate  </li>
<li>or to express a general lack of certitude in what you're describing</li>
</ul>
<p>eg:<br />
<em>Mgr: When will feature X be completed?<br />me: well, the specification is still squishy, but I expect in about a week.<br />
or<br />
me: I think I know how to solve the problem but it still seems a bit squishy.</em> </p>
<p>I started using it for lack of a better word at the time, soon the whole team was using it. Its use eventually faded but I still recall it with fondness.</p>

<p>-<em>Do you need a plant to correct this bug?</em></p>
<p>-<em>Well yes, I do, thanks!</em></p>
<p>When a programmer is stuck with a problem, he sometimes need to talk about it, so I would go to his desk and <em>do the plant</em>, not really talking but leaving him the chance to explain what is his problem and explain how the code works. It usually comes with a realization part, he just stops, and then says Ok, thank you!, at which point I say No problem, and return to my desk. It could be a theoretical nuclear problem and I could help correcting it, since there's no real interaction, meaning you could very well explain the bug to a plant there would be no difference.</p>

                <p>Does <strong>jargonology</strong> used within just three programmers, and I was not the one coining them, qualify?</p>
<p>Colleagues were commenting on frequency of <strong>inheritance classes</strong>, to inherit projects from people who were quiting. Then they were getting <strong>bug-bitten</strong> and had too many <strong>bugbites</strong> due to the applications. They would call me over as they believed a third pair of eyes would help spot errors. They would explain how a segment of code works to help me spot their errors. Miraculously, as they explained, they would spot the bugs themselves and solved them. So, they believed I was an effective <strong>bugicide</strong> as bugs evaporate with my mere presence. I protested that I did not do anything, but merely listened. And finally we settled on calling me a <strong>software therapist</strong>. They tried to advertise me to other programmers to have <strong>software therapy</strong> sessions with me because not only was I familiar with client side and server side, I was also effective with <strong>bug side</strong> code.</p>
<p>Those were the days when we used Cobol and CODASYL (network database), migrating to C/C++, Oracle and Sybase = <strong>deCobolize</strong> and <strong>SQLization</strong>. Today, the programming world has turned a full circle and with hadoop, we would have called it <strong>deSQLization</strong> (but we don't work together anymore) - back to network data relationships.</p>

                <p><strong>Specification Debt</strong></p>
<p>A play on 'technical debt', referring to the cost of 'coding to assumptions' in software requirements, without taking the time to ask for confirmation.</p>
<p>You can save time in the short term by coding right off the bat, but you'll pay for it in super-high interest later.</p>
<p>I find that it's a good phrase to use to communicate to stakeholders the importance of getting the reqs right first time.</p>

                <p><strong>KOP (Kick Oriented Programming)</strong> - I coined this term mainly because when I'm too lazy to develop something (for being tired, sleepy or something), but I still want to do something, I invoke Chuck Norris name, and I get this programming paradigm in my spirit. So, you should use this term, to denote a code in which it was made using only your intuition, and nothing more. Sometimes you would like to develop it using <strong><em>random logic formation</em></strong>, but this is allowed only for <strong><em>Jedi programmers</em></strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Jedi Programmer</strong> - This is the guy who when our team is at the deadline to the final attack, and we don't believe we're going to live after that, he comes, and by using not-known-by-most-ppl skills, he carries the project to final product. And everyone promises him, a pizza party @ Pizza Planet, he feels so happy.</p>

<p><strong>The Death Spriral</strong> - when attempting to resolve a bug. You start with, break statements, then printf(s), then some other tool e.g. wire-shark, logic analyzer, scope, other programmers. Each new tool adds complexity and seems to take you further away from the problem. The solution, pull-up, go home solve it with a clear head. </p>

a spiral is a curve which emanates from a central point, getting progressively farther away as it revolves around the point.</p>

<p>However, it turns out that you still need to know how the optimizers work for the queries to be efficient and thus need to think your queries both in sets and in procedures.</p>

                <p><strong>Functuality</strong> - Used when function != or match reality.</p>
<p>Was first used about 8-10 years ago when a PM stormed into the dev room enraged and complaining. Like all great myths, no one recalls exactly what was said, but it was something to the effect, "The functuality of this product sucks!". After the we humble devs quit laughing, it took on the meaning above.</p>
<p>To this day, I'm not sure if it was on purpose (33% sure) or the result of babbling (66% sure).</p>
<p>Edit:</p>
<p><strong>ANSI bit-masking</strong> - The usage of a database, unique table and VCHAR field instead of an enumeration or bit fields.</p>
<p>True story, about 10 years ago we hired a programmer who was (admittedly) far more DBA than developer. During a code review, we found some code that referenced a DB and grabbed a string value from a table. After retrieving said data, a for loop was applied to determine if the character at position n, was either '_' or 'X'. Based on that finding certain logic was applied. When shown a bit-field in code the reply was "oh, didn't you know you could do that."  To this day, it's battle cry when using sarcasm to find the most convoluted way to do something.</p>
<p>Edit 2:</p>
<p><strong>SYFT</strong> - pronounced "sift". Stands for Synchronize Your F**k-off Time. Used in response management's attempts &amp; desires to fill an iteration with meetings everyday instead of attempting to group them in a logical fashion at the iteration bookends. I've heard <em>cough</em> that some shops have meetings or other non development tasks nearly daily over an entire two week iteration instead of attempting to as many as possible to one day.</p>

                <p><strong>Proctalgia</strong> - I didn't coin it, but it's a synonymous of "Pain in the ass", and we use it a lot. It's also needed to explain the following term.</p>
<p><strong>Vegetable replacement</strong> - We had a java singleton class named xxxCustomerBean, and since testing with singletons is a proctalgia (see above), we have a test-initialization class, where we take the singleton instance, create a new compatible object or proxy, and substitute the original one through reflection: after a "getField()" on the original instance, we "enter the customer bean field to replace the bean". Since then, using reflection to test around singletons has become "vegetable replacement".</p>

                <p><strong>Optimize the correctness right out of the code</strong> - Excessive application of optimizing code by hand which eventually results in broken code.</p>
<p>We all know programmers who spend far too much of their time trying to optimize methods by hand (eg, re-using variables to save stack space, moving too much code out of inner loops, etc.) rather than spending time getting the code to just plain work properly. It's a fact that at least 80% of code does not need optimizing, since it's run only once or less than 10% of the total CPU time of the program. Overly aggressive hand optimization also obfuscates the source code, making it unmaintainable.  </p>

<p>Coined by my old boss, Rick Cline.  Now retired, he started his programming career in 1959.  Here's the entry I submitted to the Jargon File (aka <em>The Hacker's Dictionary</em>) in 1994.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>(Applied Data Research) Crashed or wedged. Usually said of a machine that provides some service to a network, such as a file server. This Dallas regionalism derives from the East Texas oilfield lament, "Shut 'er down, Ma, she's a-suckin' mud". Often used as a query. "We are going to reconfigure the network, are you ready to suck mud?"</p>

During its start-up stages when the company's founder and CTO, Harvard Young, had free rein over their social network software he would often be enthusiastic in responding to client requests for small customization changes here and there. These changes would quite often be useless during a build-out for a different client, or at the worst, a hindrance to development or implementation work. We ended his practice with the implementation of strict software roadmaps, revision and quality control policies, but not before giving these oddballs the affectionate term "Harv features".</p>

<p>I didn't invent this term. I picked it up from colleagues about a decade ago when working with multidisciplinary groups of engineers, software developers and technicians on large system integrations. There'd be so many loose ends during early days of integration that classifying an issue as a <strong>Joott</strong> was a way to put it off or forget it.</p>
<p>I'd like to think that once the big issues got resolved, what were <strong>Jootts</strong> in the early days of itegration <em>did</em> get looked at in the final days prior to shipping. Or maybe they just became the latent defects that second and third line support engineers would have to deal with months later ;)</p>

<p>On a not-so-small C project, making a stupid and difficult to spot typo (or other dumb error) in a header file included in just about every compilation unit. Depending on your compiler settings, the results range from a single error message to hundreds. Depending on sleep levels, prevailing sanity, etc, time to fix can range from seconds to intervals best measured in multiples of the time it typically takes you to find your keys when you're already running late for something.</p>
<p>(For added word play, pronounce it to rhyme with "elide," because that's what your vision centres will do to the mistake when you look for it.)</p>

               (1)    
              I&#39;m reminded of when a fat-finger typo removed a critical parenthesis (or maybe added one?) from a <i>very</i> common macro in a large C project. Not one file in the <code>make -k clean build</code> run would successfully compile and the errors were legion, sometimes hundreds per file. OK, I found it rapidly but the first thought on seeing the build log was definitely “WTF!” Added bonus points if the compiler produces so much output per file that your terminal no longer contains the first location of the error… - <b> Donal Fellows</b>

But your friend, looking at the code for 30 seconds will see it immediately. </p>
